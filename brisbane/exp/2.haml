      %p.description
        University students graduate every year, and enter the workforce often unprepared or unsure of what they'll encounter in the workplace. On 3rd May, 2014 ThoughtWorks is changing that. We are bringing together passionate students that love software development with professional technical visionaries and engineers to explore the future together.
