        When you start the course you will meet your team and product owner. From then on you will work with your team to deliver working software. The LevelUp team will offer guidance and hands-on support to help you get your product across the line. Make no mistake though, it's you who will be getting the job done!

      <div class='question'>
        When will the LevelUp course be held?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Kickoff day is on Saturday the 14th of March and is filled with games, workshops and group work. Then we'll meet weekly from the 17th of March, every
        <strong>Tuesday night</strong>
        from 6pm till 9pm, for 7 weeks (with a week off for Easter). There's a special day set aside on Saturday the 9th of May for your team's final showcase and the graduation ceremony.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What are the different roles?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership and the overall quality of the project. You will have to collaborate on
        <strong>all</strong>
        aspects of the project to ensure kick-ass software!
        <ul id='selector'>
          <li>Analysts work closely with product owners to capture requirements and figure out the details.</li>
          <li>Developers build the software.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        Is this an internship?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        LevelUp events are not internships, but you will receive a certificate to show that you've taken part.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?</div>
      <div class='answer'>To make this the best experience we can, we need cross functional teams with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business analyst and tester). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, places are limited.</div>
