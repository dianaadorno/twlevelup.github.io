We are bringing together computer science and information technology students with professional technical visionaries and engineers to explore the future together.

      .question
        How?

      .answer
        When you start the course you will meet your team, product owners and come up with a concept for a video game. From then on you will work with your team to deliver a game. The LevelUp team will offer guidance and hands-on support to help you get your software across the line. Make no mistake though, it's you who will be getting the job done!

      .question
        When is it?
      .answer
        The kickoff day is on the 22nd March and filled with games, workshops and group work. Then, we meet weekly from the 24th of March, every 
        %strong Monday night 
        from 6pm till 9pm.

      .question
        What are the different roles?
      .answer
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership, overall quality. You will have to collaborate on 
        %strong all 
        aspects of the project to ensure a kick-ass game!

        %ul#selector
          %li Business analysts work closely with product owners to capture requirements and figure out the details.
          %li Developers will build the game.
          %li Testers help ensure the overall quality of the product, and provide feedback to developers and business analysts.

      .question
        What happens when I pick a role&mdash;am I stuck with it?
      .answer
        In order to ensure balanced teams, we need people to stick with their role. However, because this is an agile team, just because you're a developer doesn't mean you'll be writing code all the time.

      .question
        What do I need to bring?
      .answer
        Developers 
        %strong must
        bring their own laptop. Food and drinks will be provided. If you're not a developer, a laptop is useful but not essential.

      .question
        But I don't know anything about video games.
      .answer
        I'm sure you have some awesome ideas though.

      .question Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?
      .answer To make this the best experience we can we need cross functional teams with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business analyst and tester). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, places are limited.
